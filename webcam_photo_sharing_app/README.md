# About
This is an application that uses Webcam of the users to capture an Image and allow them to 
share the image using Content Delivery Network (CDN) by generating a link of the image uploaded to CDN.
An UI interface is built using Kivy for this system

## Working
This application has User Interface which will have 2 screens. First landing screen will allow the user to 
start or stop button to access the web camera and capture button to capture the image. Once image has been captured
the second screen appears where the captured image is displayed and a button to create a CDN link. 
There are 2 more buttons that allow user to copy the generated link or open the image in the internet.
