# About
Let us assume there are 2 people living in a flat and they want to share the rent amount based on 
the number of days stayed instead of sharing equally.

This application is the solution for above stated problem. It is build with Object Oriented Programming by using
python classes.

## Working
It works in Command Line Interface where the user inputs their name and shared flatmates name and number of days
each person stayed for the mentioned period.

The program calculates the share to be paid by each person with proportion to the number of days stayed 
given by the user and outputs the result. 

Also, it generates a PDF report on the amount to be paid by each other.
