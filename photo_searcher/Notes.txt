This my personal notes from the tutorial to understand about Kivy

We are using Kivy here.

There are 4 objects in kivy library.

1. App
    - An app as the whole application
2. Screen Manager
    - Inbuilt manager for managing screen usually we dont edit unless needed
3. Screen
    - Need to write as many screen class as we desire to have in our App. Example login page is a screen and after login
      A screen to be displayed is another one.
4. Widgets
    - Like buttons, Textinput, Image, Dropdown etc.

We have Classes for all the above in Kivy Library
